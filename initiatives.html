                 <p>*How to 'say' it* is an idea driven into action, taking in account the fear of almost every student who is struggling with common problems like fear of speaking, discussion in public etc.

Here we tend to drive away the fears of speaking out our thoughts, improving the diction, vocabulary, confidence and grammar of every participant through perfectly programmed sessions, which are conducted every week.

The idea was originated by Akshay Jain, who is an engineering student at Bharati Vidyapeeth University, and also an avid speaker, poet and a great anchor.

When the idea came into existence, it quickly spread throughout the campus due to the amount of interest received by the students. Activities include speeches, group Discussion, debate, review, error rectification and other various activities.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

                 <p>Tutor Pros is a startup firm to get you about the site and who are we. So, lets begin with the fact that why we’ve made this site. It’s we who’ve felt the heat of the things that became almost impossible to receive in our daily lives, especially the study materials that we went wayward into things that got to us a lot of extra bucks to spend and then at last, we’re reaching almost nowhere in our quest for knowledge. Since, we felt this hell of fire on our face in the quest of finding an ultimate solution of the problems related to your engineering academics, we’ll not let you do the folly that we did. So, we’ve brought a site that’ll not only bring you close to your solutions but also bring you in contact with the pros who’ll tutor you in a way that you’ll be in the driving seat in the ergonomics of the world of engineering academics.</p>
